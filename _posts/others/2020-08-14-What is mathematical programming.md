From a view of master, we think a little about what is optimization?





# What is mathematical programming?

Mathematical programming is the study or use of the mathematical program.

It includes any of all of the following:

1. **Theorems about the form** of a solution, including whether one exists;
2. **Algorithms** to seek a solution or ascertain that none exists;
3. **Formulation of problems into mathematical programs**, including understanding the quality of one formulation in comparison with another;
4. **Analysis of results**, including debugging situations, such as infeasible or anomalous values;
5. **Theorems about the model structure,** including properties pertaining to feasibility, redundancy and/or implied relations (such theorems could be to support analysis of results or design of algorithms);
6. **Theorems about approximation** arising from imperfections of model forms, levels of aggregation, computational error, and other deviations;
7. **Developments** in connection with other disciplines, such as a computing environment.

#Under my view:

**Theorem and Model**:

1)***theorem about the form***(==subfield==, and in subfield such as convex set& convex function......==constrained==)

2)***theorem about the model structure***(==optimal condition==(neccesarry and sufficient)/ ==sensitivity analysis==)

**Approximation and Algorithm**:

1)***Theorem about approximation***(==Dual theorem==&other approach,like SAA)

2)***Algorithm***(==convergence==&==stop time==&==speed==)

**Application**:

1)***Formulation of problems into mathematical programming***(==formulation==& ==explanation==& ==comparison==)

2)***Analysis of the result***(==the meaning of lagrange multiplier?== Like  shadow price)
